# School_District_Analysis

# Overview
	In this analysis, we will be working with two sets of data (school_complete.csv,students_complete.csv). During this project, we will look to change Thomas High School's 9th-grade reading and math scores to NaN's and repeat the analysis without these scores. 

# Results
* Changing all Thomas High School's 9th-grade scores to "nan" will cause a change in the analysis numbers for this school and the overall numbers for the district analysis. 
* As in our school district analysis, making changes to Thomas Highschool will require us to change the school summary as the 9th-grade scores were used to complete the analysis.
* Using the 9th grader's scores will give false results in our report since these were showing academic dishonesty.
* When looking at the first school report (Thomas High School included), this school's 9th grade had scores: math: 83.6, reading: 83.7. Their 10th-grade scores were: math: 83.1, reading: 84.2. Their 11th-grade scores were: math: 83.5, reading: 83.6. And for their 12th-grade score: math: 83.5, reading: 83.5. When comparing both results by grade scores, we do not see any changes since the 9th grader's scores do not affect the scores by grade. 
* Scores by school spending: in the spending range of $630-644, we can see a difference of 0.01% (78.51 to 78.50) in the math scores. Average reading scores: 81.62 with THS 9th-graders and 81.63 without them. Passing math scores: 73.48 (using 9th-graders data), 73.46 (without). Passing readding%with 9th- graders: 84.39, 84.31 (without). Overall score: 62.85 with 9th graders, 62.77 (without). 
* Scores by school type, we see a change in Charter schools. Average math(83.47 to 83.46), reading (83.89 to 83.90), % passing math (93.62 to 93.61), %passing reading (96.58 to 96.55), overall passing % (90.43 to 90.39)

# Summary 
We observed a change in the scores by school spending in the range of $630-644 of 0.01% in math scores reading scores. 
The most significant change observed is in the overall percentages scores, where we see a .08% change in percentage.
